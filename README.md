eDEX-UI is a fullscreen desktop application resembling a sci-fi computer interface, heavily inspired from [DEX-UI](https://github.com/seenaburns/dex-ui) and the [TRON Legacy movie effects](https://web.archive.org/web/20170511000410/http://jtnimoy.com/blogs/projects/14881671). It runs the shell of your choice in a real terminal, and displays live information about your system. It was made to be used on large touchscreens but will work nicely on a regular desktop computer or perhaps a tablet PC or one of those funky 360° laptops with touchscreens.

I had no ideas for a name so i took DEX-UI and added a "e" for Electron. Deal with it.

## Q&A
#### What OS can this thing run on?
Currently Windows, the latest macOS and any Linux distro that can run Chromium (AppImage package).
#### Is this a real terminal?
Yes. By default, eDEX runs bash on Linux and Powershell on Windows, but you can change that to any command in the settings.json file.
#### I don't like the colors/the keyboard layout is not right for me!
We got you covered! Check the [repo's Wiki](https://github.com/GitSquared/edex-ui/wiki) for in-depth information about customizing eDEX.
#### Why is there a keyboard?
eDEX-UI is meant to be used on touchscreens, even if it works well on regular displays! If you have a physical keyboard wired to your computer, pressing keys IRL will illuminate the virtual keyboard: *please remember to not type any passwords if you are recording your screen!*
#### What's the difference between this and the original DEX-UI?
Seenaburns' DEX-UI was created _"as an experiment or an art piece, not distributable software"_. The goal of this project is to push Seena's vision forward by making such an interface usable in real-life scenarios.
#### Will using this make me insanely badass?
Yes.

## Useful commands for the nerds
#### Starting from source:

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** the following instructions are meant **for DEVELOPERS ONLY**. If you're just a casual user please download the precompiled binaries available on the [Releases tab](https://github.com/GitSquared/edex-ui/releases).

on *nix systems (You'll need the Xcode command line tools on macOS):
- clone the repository
- `npm run install-linux`
- `npm start`

on Windows:
- start cmd or powershell **as administrator**
- clone the repository
- `npm run install-windows`
- `npm start`
#### Building
Note: Due to native modules, you can only compile binaries for the OS you are compiling from.
Note²: It is recommended to start building from a fresh clone to prevent the code minifier script from parsing an entire `node_modules` folder.

- make a fresh clone (recommended)
- `npm install` (NOT `install-linux` or `install-windows`)
- `npm run build-linux` or `build-windows` or `build-darwin`

Resulting binaries and assets will be in the `dist` folder.

## Credits
eDEX-UI's source code was primarily written by me, [Squared](https://github.com/GitSquared). If you want to get in touch with me or find other projects I'm involved in, check out [my website](https://squared.codebrew.fr).

[PixelyIon](https://github.com/PixelyIon) helped me get started with Windows compatibility and offered some precious advice when I started to work on this project seriously.

## Thanks
Of course, eDEX would never have existed if I hadn't stumbled upon the amazing work of [Seena](https://github.com/seenaburns) on [r/unixporn](https://reddit.com/r/unixporn).

This project uses a bunch of open-source libraries, frameworks and tools, see [the full dependency graph](https://github.com/GitSquared/edex-ui/network/dependencies).

I want to namely thank the developers behind [xterm.js](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js), [systeminformation](https://github.com/sebhildebrandt/systeminformation) and [SmoothieCharts](https://github.com/joewalnes/smoothie).

Huge thanks to [Rob "Arscan" Scanlon](https://github.com/arscan) for making the fantastic [ENCOM Globe](https://github.com/arscan/encom-globe), also inspired by the TRON: Legacy movie, and distributing it freely. His work really puts the icing on the cake.
