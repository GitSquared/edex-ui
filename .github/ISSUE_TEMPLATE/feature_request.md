**Perceived idea awesomeness**
- [ ] Wow, you don't have this yet???
- [ ] Would be super cool.
- [ ] I'm not sure a lot of people would use it, but I'd love to have it.
- [ ] Kind of a gadget, honestly, but why not?

**Perceived idea difficulty**
- [ ] Quit your job first.
- [ ] Would need some work, but nothing impossible.
- [ ] Shouldn't be too hard to make.
- [ ] Like, *I* could do it.
